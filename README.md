# Arco Underground - Multi-Stage Digital Forensics Investigation

## Project Overview
A comprehensive forensic investigation spanning three progressive stages, exploring a potential underground tunnel plot involving digital evidence, network analysis, and multiple actors at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST).

## Investigation Stages

### Stage I: Pen Drive Forensics
- **Focus**: Analyze lost pen drive artifacts
- **Key Discoveries**:
  - Potential owner identification
  - Steganographic secret extraction
  - Initial plot indications
- **Tools**: Steganography detection, forensic image analysis

### Stage II: Computer Disk Forensics
- **Focus**: Examine César Silva Ferro's computer hard drives
- **Key Objectives**:
  - Trace hidden artifacts
  - Analyze file provenance
  - Detect anti-forensic activities
- **Artifacts**: Workstation and backup server disk images

### Stage III: Network Forensics
- **Focus**: Network trace analysis at DEI
- **Key Investigations**:
  - Document transfer evidence
  - Actor identification
  - Exfiltration timeline reconstruction
- **Tools**: Network traffic analysis, HTTPS decryption

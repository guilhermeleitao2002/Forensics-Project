# Arco Underground - Digital Forensics Investigation (Stage II)

## Project Overview
Continuing the forensic investigation from Stage I, this project focuses on analyzing hard disk images from computers belonging to César Silva Ferro, a key person of interest in an ongoing investigation.

## Objective
Conduct an in-depth forensic examination of two computer hard drive images to:
- Trace hidden artifacts from the previous investigation
- Analyze file origins and manipulation
- Detect potential anti-forensic activities
- Uncover additional information about the suspected underground plot

## Forensic Artifacts
### Disk Images
1. **caesarDisk.tar.gz**: Workstation hard drive image
2. **backupDisk.tar.gz**: Backup server hard drive image

### Previously Discovered Hidden Artifacts
- Anonymous letter (f1.pdf)
- Bank statement (f2.png)
- Underground photo (f3.jpeg)
- Tunnel blueprint (f4.jpeg)
- Video footage (f5.mp4)
- Number artifact: 1683461

## Key Investigation Tasks
1. **Artifact Tracing**
   - Locate traces of hidden artifacts on César Silva Ferro's computers
   - Verify presence and integrity of previously discovered files

2. **File Provenance Analysis**
   - Establish a comprehensive timeline of file movements
   - Track file modifications and interactions
   - Identify potential sources and transmission methods

3. **Anti-Forensic Detection**
   - Investigate potential attempts to hide or manipulate digital evidence
   - Analyze system logs, file metadata, and suspicious activities

4. **Plot Investigation**
   - Uncover new information about the suspected underground tunnel project
   - Identify potential additional actors or connections
   - Gather evidence to support or refute the existing hypothesis
